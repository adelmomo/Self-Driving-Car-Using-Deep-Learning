# Self-Driving-Car-Using-Deep-Learning
Self-driving car is an end-to-end autonomous self driving car system that drives a car from point A to point B without human intervention in the shortest path. Carla simulator is used in this project, carla simulator is a state of the art platform for self-driving car research. This project proposes a self-driving car system using end-to-end deep learning, the car in the simulator is controlled by an end-to-end deep neural network that is conditioned by A* algorithm to find the shortest path between point A and point B. Read the readme.txt file to run this project on your machine and the project thesis to understand the proposed system in details.
